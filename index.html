            <p class="sectionSubTag text_small">Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs) is a system of central schools for
                talented students predominantly from rural areas in India. They are run by Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti,
                New Delhi, an autonomous organization under the Department of School Education and Literacy, Ministry of
                Education (MoE),[a] Government of India. JNVs are fully residential and co-educational schools
                affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), New Delhi, with classes from VI to XII
                standard.
                JNVs are specifically tasked with finding talented children in rural areas of India and providing them
                with an education equivalent to the best residential school system, without regard to their families'
                socio-economic condition.[2]

                The Budget for Education, Boarding and activities at JNVs are provided by the Ministry of Education,
                Government of India and it's free of cost for the students during the 7 years of stay.

                JNVs exist all over India, with the exception of Tamil Nadu.[3] As of 30 September 2019, 636 JNVs were
                running with about 265,574 students enrolled, out of which 206,728 (≈78%) were from rural areas. In
                2019, JNVs were the top-ranked C.B.S.E. schools, having a pass percentage of 98.57% and 96.62% in 10th
                and 12th grades respectively</p>

                History

            <p class="sectionSubTag text_small">The idea of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas conceived by former Prime
                Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi.[6][7] The concept of opening a JNV in every district of India was born
                as a part of the National Policy on Education, 1986 with an aim of providing excellence coupled with
                social justice.[8] Subsequently, Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) was registered as a society under the
                Societies Registration Act, 1860.[8]

                As per policy of the government, one JNV was to be established in each district of country. To start
                with, two Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas were established during 1985-86, at Jhajjar (Haryana) and Amravati
                (Maharashtra).[8] As of the 2015–16 academic session, JNVs had been sanctioned for 576 districts. In
                addition, ten JNVs have been sanctioned in districts having a large population of ST population, ten in
                districts having a large concentration of SC population and two special JNVs in Manipur, bringing the
                total number of sanctioned JNVs to 598.[9] Out of these 591 JNVs are functional.[10] In November 2016,
                the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the opening of one JNV in each of the 62
                uncovered districts.[10] That will bring the total number of JNVs to 660 once operationa</p>

                Organizational Structure
            </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text_small">Navodaya Vidyalayas are run by the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), an
                autonomous organisation under the Ministry of Education (MoE)(formerly the Ministry of Human Resource
                Development (MHRD) (1985–2020) ), Department of School Education and Literacy, Govt. of India. The
                Chairman of the Samiti is the Minister of Education.[11][12]

                The Samiti functions through the executive committee under the Chairmanship of the Minister of
                Education. The executive committee is responsible for the management of all affairs including allocation
                of funds to the Samiti and has the authority to exercise all powers of Samiti. It is assisted by two
                sub-committees, the Finance Committee and Academic Advisory Committee.[12] The executive head of the
                administrative pyramid is the Commissioner who executes the policies laid down by the Samiti's executive
                committee. He/she is assisted at the Headquarters level by Joint Commissioners, Deputy Commissioners and
                Assistant Commissioners. The Samiti has established eight regional offices for the administration and
                monitoring of Navodaya Vidyalayas under their jurisdiction. These offices are headed by a deputy
                commissioner and assistant commissioners.[12]

                For each JNV, there is a Vidyalaya Advisory Committee for assistance on matters of academics,
                infrastructure and other general activities and a Vidyalaya Management Committee for budget preparation,
                selection of ad-hoc teachers and proper functioning of the school.[11] Normally the district collector
                of the concerned district is the ex-officio chairman of school level committees with local
                educationists, public representatives and officers from the district as members. Some schools also have
                a Vidhyalaya Coordination Committee for looking after the performance of academic</p>
